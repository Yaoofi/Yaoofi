            <p>My name is Yaoofi</p>
            <p>I am primarily a C# programmer but I also like making projects with Arduino, or any programable things. I also like 3D modeling/printing, and other sorts of digital art. I like listening to music, especially metal or rock. My favorite band is Metallica<br></p>
